                <h1>Lyft<br>Regulatory Reporting Internship - Summer 2019</h1>
            </div>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div id="overview-div">
                <p class="body-text f-left">In the summer of 2019, I had the amazing opportunity to intern on Lyft's Regulatory Reporting team for 10 weeks. The team is responsible for building data reports to send to regulators in Lyft's markets all across the United States and Canada. I spent the summer working on programming projects that would streamline reporting processes, and I also built and sent out a few data reports. As my first experience at a big tech company, I was excited to work with Lyft's data and have the opportunity to work with other members of Lyft's Compliance team and cross-functionally with engineers. Special shout outs to my manager, <a class="special-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardmaldonadojr/" target="_blocked">Ted Maldonado</a>, and my mentor, <a class="special-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-falcon-2750934a/" target="_blocked">Keith Falcon</a>!</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p class="body-text"><strong>Data Report Automation</strong><br>For my main project, I pioneered an automation effort and developed a script that eliminates manual data report processes in Apache Airflow. The goal was to create a template that my team could use to turn their manual data report processes into fully automated processes to gain back work time on smaller, more monotonous reports. Learn more <a class="special-link" href="data-automation.html">here</a>.
              <br><br><strong>Data File Merger</strong><br>My manager needed a more efficient way to merge and de-dupe daily data files for one of his big reports, so I wrote a Python/Pandas script that can run from the command line to do the heavy lifting of merging data files for any dates inputted.
              <br><br><strong>Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)</strong><br>I created an entity relationship diagram (ERD) in Lucidchart that visualizes the column relationships between the most important data tables that the Regulatory Reporting team uses. Most, if not all, of the Regulatory Reporting team's data reports need to join different tables of data, so the ERD shows the many relationships and intricacies that allow tables from different parts of Lyft's business to be joined together. The ERD is now part of the on-boarding process for the Regulatory Reporting team's new hires.
              <br><br><strong>Ad Hoc Data Requests</strong><br>I occasionally wrote advanced SQL queries to pull data for 10+ ad hoc data requests from regulators all over the country. I received the full Regulatory Reporting experience!</p>

            <div class="text-spacing"><p class="body-text"><strong>Girls Who Code Visit</strong><br>In June, a Girls Who Code class from BlackRock visited the Lyft HQ for a field trip. I had the opportunity to co-lead a programming activity for the class with the help of another Lyft intern, Jessica Wang. We created an introduction to conditional statements activity that didn't involve any computers. As a Girls Who Code alumni, I was grateful to give back to a program that had such a monumental impact on my life!</p></div>
